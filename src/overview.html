		<p>This is a fan WiP project coded in free time and originally intended for my personal use only as JavaFX exercise, so there's no warranty, use only on your own risk! My intention is to make it more flexible than eu4replay, to use it with old patches and with a little effort also with mods. It's still in development and probably contains a lot of bugs, I would call it pre-alfa.</p>
		<p>Used libraries (as sources) can be found in utils package: erickson's PositionInputStream and Elliot Kroo's GifSequenceWriter.</p>
